# Relevant Improvements and Enhancements

This document outlines potential improvements and corrections for the RISC-V CPU Core Simulation project.

## 1. **Cache Implementation**
   - **Issue**: The cache implementation in `cache.sv` uses a direct-mapped cache with a simple write-back policy. This may not be efficient for all use cases.
   - **Improvement**: Implement a more sophisticated cache replacement policy (e.g., LRU) and support for associative caches.

## 2. **Floating-Point Unit (FPU)**
   - **Issue**: The FPU implementation in `fpu.sv` lacks proper handling of special cases like NaN, infinity, and denormalized numbers.
   - **Improvement**: Add proper handling for special cases and improve the accuracy of floating-point operations.

## 3. **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**
   - **Issue**: The MMU in `mmu.sv` does not implement virtual-to-physical address translation.
   - **Improvement**: Implement a basic page table and support for virtual memory.

## 4. **Control Unit (CU)**
   - **Issue**: The control unit in `cu.sv` only supports a limited set of instructions.
   - **Improvement**: Extend the control unit to support more RISC-V instructions, including branches and jumps.

## 5. **Testbenches**
   - **Issue**: The testbenches are minimal and do not cover all edge cases.
   - **Improvement**: Add more comprehensive test cases to ensure robustness.

## 6. **Documentation**
   - **Issue**: The project lacks detailed documentation.
   - **Improvement**: Add detailed comments in the code and create a user guide for the project.

## 7. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Issue**: The current implementation may not be optimized for performance.
   - **Improvement**: Profile the design and optimize critical paths.

## 8. **Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: The design lacks proper error handling for invalid inputs.
   - **Improvement**: Add error handling mechanisms to improve robustness.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Using Icarus Verilog**:
   - Compile and run the testbench:
   
     iverilog -o alu_tb alu_tb.sv alu.sv
     vvp alu_tb
     
   - Repeat for other testbenches.

2. **Using Docker**:
   - Build the Docker image:
     
     docker build -t riscv-cpu-sim -f Dockerfile .
     
   - Run the simulation in a container:
     
     docker run -it riscv-cpu-sim
     

3. **Using GitHub Actions**:
   - Push your code to GitHub, and the CI/CD pipeline will automatically run the testbenches.
